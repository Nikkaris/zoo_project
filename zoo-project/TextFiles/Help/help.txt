---prologue---
Welcome to our game!
We are happy that you are here. Anyway if you want to start game press [1] in main menu.

Then you have to choose difficulty. For newcomers i would suggest Easy / Normal.
Hard difficulty is for experienced hardcore gamers, who are familiary with souls like games.

Grab a drink and popcorn, get ready, because you started your own adventure. 

---action menu---
Most of the time you have to choose from several actions in action menu.
To complete your action you have to write to terminal number/letter, which is located in square brackets.

Example:
[1] Action 1
[2] Action 2
 1
I am doing Action 1...

From there is everything pretty intuitive.

---location map---
Your movements across the location map are made through action menu. If you want to interact
with something you have to get on the proper tile.

Location legend:
 Tile(ex. |____| ) - smallest piece of location, there is variety of tiles and most of them are accesible
 ** - your actual position
 FR - NPC (non-player character)
 E1 - enemy and level of the enemy (in this particular we have enemy with level 1)
 CH - chest (there is two types of chests: locked and unlocked, locked ones can be unlocked through keys)
 EXIT - tile for exiting location

---fighting system---
When you step on tile marked with enemy sign, you have option to fight enemy.
If you do so. You start fight with your current HP and maximum of Stamina. 
Enemy will atack you every round of fight. You have option to strike him with light or heavy attack. 
Light attack do less damage but cost less stamina and heavy attack hit harder 
but cost a way more stamina.

If you don't have enough stamina to perfom any kind of attack, you have to you "rest" action
in action menu. In this case enemy will still perform his attack.
