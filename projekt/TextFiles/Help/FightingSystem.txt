---------------------------------------------Fighting system---------------------------------------------
When you step on tile marked with enemy sign, you have option to fight enemy.
If you do so. You start fight with your current HP and maximum of Stamina. 
Enemy will atack you every round of fight. You have option to strike him with light or heavy attack. 
Light attack do less damage but cost less stamina and heavy attack hit harder 
but cost a way more stamina.

If you don't have enough stamina to perfom any kind of attack, you have to you "rest" action
in action menu. In this case enemy will still perform his attack.

Your two or your stats are directly helping during the battle.

Agility - makes your stamina much more effective during fight (your attacks cost less stamina)
Strenght - your attacks are dealing more damage

Last one is little bit tricky. Flirt give you romance option for NPCs. If you have higher charisma then 
NPC, you will get lasting damage bonus based on their stamina.
